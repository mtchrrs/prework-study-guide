# UWA Coding Bootcamp Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This webpage is based around the idea of creating one space where all of the study notes for the prework to the bootcamp will live.
It allows me to navigate to one designated space to be able to find consolidated notes.
The website itself allows me to have a reference point for my future projects.
I made many mistakes throughout the process but I am very happy to announce my first webpage!
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

There are no installation requirements, simply type in the URL and there you go. 

## Usage

Follow the directions on the webpage to get it running to full capacity (i.e. need to open console to get the most out of the content)

## Credits

Followed tutorials and 'prework' as created through the UWA Coding Bootcamp
